# MineroBitcoin

We are going to try to "emulate" at a local level what would be a blockchain node where each of the students in the class will be a bitcoin miner.

Each bitcoin miner will generate a file (which is the equivalent of a block) with the following structure: you must put your full name and surname, the hash of the previous block and the nonce that makes the hash (sha1) of your file start with 00 .
File:

Name and Surname: ******************
Previous hash: 00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
Nonce: ****

Hash:

SHA1 (block) = *********************************************
